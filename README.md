# Fraud Detection System for E-Commerce and Banking

A machine learning-based fraud detection system designed to identify fraudulent transactions in e-commerce and banking sectors. This project includes model training, API deployment, and an interactive dashboard for real-time insights.

---

## Key Features
- **Multi-Model Ensemble**: Combines predictions from XGBoost, Random Forest, and Logistic Regression using stacking/weighted averaging.
- **Real-Time API**: Flask-based REST API for fraud prediction.
- **Interactive Dashboard**: Dash/Plotly dashboard for visualizing fraud trends, geolocation analysis, and device/browser insights.
- **Model Explainability**: SHAP and LIME integration for interpretable predictions.
- **Docker Support**: Containerized deployment for scalability.

---

## Configuration
1. Place your datasets in the `data/` folder:
   - `Fraud_Data.csv`
   - `IpAddress_to_Country.csv`

---

## Running the Application

### Flask API
```bash
python app.py
```
- API runs at `http://localhost:5000`.

### Dash Dashboard
Access the dashboard at `http://localhost:5000/dashboard`.

### Docker
```bash
docker build -t fraud-detection .
docker run -p 5000:5000 fraud-detection
```

---

## Model Training

### Base Models
Train individual models:
```bash
python train_xgb.py  # XGBoost
python train_rf.py   # Random Forest
```

### Stacking/Weighted Averaging
1. Train base models and generate predictions:
   ```python
   python ensemble.py --method stacking  # or weighted_averaging
   ```

2. Evaluate ensemble performance:
   ```bash
   python evaluate.py
   ```

---

### Response
```json
{
  "prediction": 1
}
